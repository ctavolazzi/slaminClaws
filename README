The code is commented out because I wrote a lot of it not knowing what the hell I was doing.

Someday I'll write a comprehensive readme, but I need to work on the base code a lot more. 

Sorry for not having a better readme. If you're disappointed, follow me here on GitHub to let me know how mad you are.

It's just a proof of concept right now. But it's cool and I like it!

Run the files in the same folder and play around with the buttons. 

It's all default style for now.
