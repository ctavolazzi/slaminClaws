OCTOBER 2020 UPDATE:

I completely rewrote the game several times, and finally I think I've found a version that's clean, concise, and scalable.

All files from outdated versions have been deleted.

Why are they there? Because I don't know how to use GitHub very well and I don't know how to delete stuff.

I'm too sleepy to learn right now. It's 11:06 pm in California as I write this update.

Check out the new version. It's simple, but it shows what I know how to do at this point in my coding journey. 

Been studying since March and I'm pretty proud of the progress I've made. This version is the cleanest yet.


ORIGINAL README:

The code is commented out because I wrote a lot of it not knowing what the hell I was doing.

Someday I'll write a comprehensive readme, but I need to work on the base code a lot more. 

Sorry for not having a better readme. If you're disappointed, follow me here on GitHub to let me know how mad you are.

It's just a proof of concept right now. But it's cool and I like it!

Run the files in the same folder and play around with the buttons. 

It's all default style for now.
